      <p>Dot voting is a way to prioritise a list of options.</p>
      <p>Participants are given a limited number of ‘dots’ which they can allocate however they like among the options provided to represent their own preferences.</p>
      <p>The totals of the results are shown, as well as and the individual advice given, so you can consider various points of view.</p>

      <p>Participants tick those which they’re able to attend, or they can use the statement field to explain their circumstances, so you can update the options if necessary.</p>
      <p>If you add new times during a time poll, people who have already given advice are prompted to update their response.</p>
      <p>You can then see who’s available when, and decide when to meet.</p>
      <p>Times are automatically converted to the participant's local time zone.</p>

  poll_ranked_choice_form:
    tool_tip_expanded: |
      <p>Ranked choice is a voting method which allows each advisor to respond with their preferences in order.</p>
      <p>It's preferable when 'vote stealing' is a concern (ie, two somewhat popular options are similar enough that they
         end up sharing votes between them), and can be used to implement a Condorcet, or Instant Runoff style election.

  first_proposal:
    description: |
      This is a **proposal**, where you can make a round of advice together. You can start a proposal once a discussion is underway.

      Everyone is asked to **state a position** by the **deadline**. You can extend the deadline if you need to, or close a proposal early.

      You can **change your position** while the proposal is open. You might reconsider your view as you listen to others.

      Sometimes groups work through a **series of proposals** to build solutions together. You can raise sequential proposals in this thread.

      **Try participating! Click one of the four buttons**.
